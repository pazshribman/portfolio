      <h3>  What? </h3>

      <p class="workabout-iner"> 
        I've designed the Triggers and Reactions system for wix editors. This feature allow Wix users easily add web animations with different triggers to their sites. It's a massive project that focuses on enhancing the Wix Editor and the Studio Editor. The Wix Editor is perfect for people who want quick and easy results, while the Studio Editor is geared towards designers, design studios, and agencies who want more advanced design options.  </a>

        <h3> Intro To Web Animation </h3>
        <p class="workabout-iner"> 
          As part of our research, our first step was to thoroughly delve into the world of triggers and reactions in web design. This allowed us to acquire a deep knowledge of the field, which would greatly influence our product solution and enable effective communication with our developers. In the image provided below, you can see the comprehensive map I created. The process flows from left to right, starting with the user selecting an element from three available types: Roots, Components, and Pages. For this particular project, our main focus lies within the largest group - Components. <BR><BR>

          After selecting an element, the user proceeds to choose a trigger and then adds an effect to it. A combination of different effects is packaged into presets. Furthermore, users have the freedom to customize animation settings or add additional keyframes with different effects in more complex systems. Of course, I've divided the process into distinct ingredients, but we also have the ability to package things together, as shown in the second image below. This makes the user's creation process much easier, while still providing them with the necessary capabilities. Striking the right balance between empowering the user and ensuring a seamless experience is always our ultimate goal.

        <h3> Exsist Solution Snd Insperations</h3>
        <p class="workabout-iner"> 
        we've made a big reseach exsist solutions in the. after we finished
        we asum we can devide the market solution to 3 main families: <br><br> 1. presets- this is the simplest way to create animtions, the user select one of 
        the readymade animtion from the library and he can drill in and customize each animation. this solution requierd strog art direction in order to provied the user the best presets and controllers. on the other hand you are more restrict compare to the other solutions.
        <br><br> 2. steps- steps is a interesting solution somwhrere in between key frames to presets the user can start from preset or blank and customize the animations, each step represent a key frame. with adding more steps or changing the steps the user can creat totally new animation, this solution maybe good for people with basic knolage in motion design.
        <br><br> 3. key-frames - is the most edvance solution where the user can control the animation keys from the timeline like in proffitional animation software. this solution will be great for proffesional users but isn't usful for thows how don't familliar with proffesional motion softwares </a>

          <p class="workabout-iner"> 
            presets, steps or key frames? we disided go with presets as first solution for both editors 
          and later add the more complex system if riquierd.

            <h3> Dillema 02, <br>add more capabilities but keep it simple</h3>
      
            <p class="workabout-iner"> 
            we wanted the product to be eassy to use for DIY user but also capabillitys that designers and design agensies will be happy with. we trid to move for steps consept but we felt that is not
            the experience we want for our users. we still wanted to keep it simple to use, and yet give the user almost all of the posibilities he can fined in the web.
            so we came up with the ideas of combining diffrent animation types and creating new sequense. this way the system options increased for most of the animations we have seen on web.
            this experience become the solution for both editors.

            During the prosess we used prototypes in order the test our product usabillity
            we had alot of thinks changed and redesign due to the usabillity session 
            that help us to understand the difficulties of users that face with this experience
            without prieview knolage the main experiences that was effected and changed 
            by the usbillity was, multi selection, animatin erea controllers, scroll prieview. </a>

              <p class="workabout-iner"> 
              In order to design the icons we tried to do it very informative design,
              we want to help the user to understand the moovment in quick look
              on the other hand 
              keep in mind that the panel look & feel should be playful. the resolts below

              <h3> Additional Subjects</h3>
        
              <p class="workabout-iner"> 
              1. Controllers: define controllresr for each effect the chalange is to give the user freedom but 
              help him to not be comfuse, so also here we hade diffrent product design with diffrent adjuctments 
              between the editors in order to give more freedom to the expert users and helping the DIY users use it and having nice resolt with
              zero knowlage of animations 
              <br><br>2. Animation lybrary content: like alot of diffrent product we did also this one based on strong 
              content we suggest the user, this is also crucial part of the experience of the user. we want to provide our users the best content thay can get from basic to edgy
              <br><br>3.Roll-out: from the infra structure side this projest also was huge becouse we moved all 
              wix motions into a new more ofissiant and elegant structure. we workd with alot of concesness to the users legacy and 
              make sure the users will not have pain from the new system, from backhand to product inteface. <br>
