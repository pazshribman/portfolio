        <h3>  Why? </h3>
        <p class="workabout-iner"> 
        Back in 2021, VR was everywere. a lot of tec copmanies puts thir effort on developing this field.
        in this project, I tried to test the relationships between a human beain to a virtual creature. the player 
        can pet, feed and play with Zigi with a ball.
      as first steps in the world of design VR experiance and creat relationships inside the virtual world. and expeiramenting
    on designing clear, interesting and fun experience in this new unknown erea.  </a>

          <h3> Design Challanges </h3>
    
          <p class="workabout-iner"> 
          From the designer perspective the main challange was 
        to make Zigi fells a life, with small body movements on idle, and the breating animation
        from his mouth ans eyes.
      Zigi is also folowing the player movements, if you will catch a ball he will look at the ball. when the player
      pet zigi he can feel his shape and vibration, all of this small adjustments togethe makes most of the peapole
      react to zigi like he is a real creature.

            <h3>  Usabillity </h3>
      
            <p class="workabout-iner"> 
            One of The most interesting part in this process was to see how peapole react
          to the experience from outside every time I observed it become very clear what peapole
        expect and what I need to change in order to give them the best experince.  one of the main example is the movement 
      controller  first  the player moved with the controller analog but most of the people just use thir legs to move
    and I went with it, this small change made the experience mounch more realistic. also at first the plan was to play
  games with Zigi, but most of the people at firt just want to meet him slowly and tring to touch him, so we designed the first expirince
to be just get in touch with Zigi and designed diffrent emotions of him on diffrent types of touch, if you will pet him he will be happy
and gargling, if user will pounch him he will be mad. </a>
